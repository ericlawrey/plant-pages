# Eustrephus latfolius
Wombat Berry

## Natural Occurrence:
A local vine, growing in sandy soils on hillsides in open
forest, dry vine thicket, heathland and rainforest margins.

## Appearance:
An evergreen, multi-stemmed, scrambling
vine to 6m on a trellis. Without support,
it can form a large clump. Small, white
flowers are followed by showy, orange
berries that split to reveal shiny, black
seeds in a white, fleshy pulp.
Tolerates a range of soils and does best in
semi-shade. Once established, tolerates dry
periods. Easy to prune. Good in a hanging basket.

## Distinctive Features:
The fleshy roots are bush tucker, raw or baked. Birds eat
the berries & root tubers attract root-eating animals.
Leaves eaten by caterpillars of at least 4 moth species.

## Botanical Family: LAXMANNIACEAE
