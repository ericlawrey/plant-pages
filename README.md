# QR Plants
This site contains information plants native to Townsville, Queensland, Australia. My goal was to create plant labels to put in my garden that contained a QR code that would point to useful information about the plant species. My problem was that traditional plant labels don't provide much information, typically just the species name. I wanted more details about the plan, but didn't want the labels to be giant and so I thought that I could put QR codes on the labels that point to information pages. 

This site currently only focuses on the very small number of plant species that reside in my garden.

## Plants:
- [Ergrostis elongata - Clustered Lovegrass](ergrostis-elongata)
