## Natural Occurrence:
A local plant of sandy/rocky areas in drier open eucalypt
forests and grasslands across northern Australia.

## Appearance:
Erect or sprawling groundcover to
~30cm. Perennial. Yellow to orange
'pea' flowers, often with dark red
markings, occur most of the year and
lead to ~1.5cm pods with constrictions
between the 1-5 seed chambers.

## Growth Conditions:
Cultivation requirements aren't well
known. Natural habitat indicates a
preference for full sun and good
drainage & a tolerance of dryness.

## Distinctive Features:
Worth trying as groundcover in rockeries or bush-themed
gardens. Attractive flowers are a feature in mass plantings.
Legume groundcovers improve soil nitrogen content.

## Botanical Family: FABACEAE
