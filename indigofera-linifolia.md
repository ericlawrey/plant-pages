An annual, self-seeding legume of grassland & eucalypt
woodland, especially where surface soil is light-textured.

salmon pink/red flowers (Mar-Sep) are followed by small,
round, silvery fruit with 1 seed. Leaves have silvery hairs.

## Growth Conditions:
Not well known in cultivation. Grows well in
full sun & in dry areas, so probably prefers
good drainage. Plants are annual, but
seeding is prolific. Spent plants can be
removed & new plants will establish readily.
