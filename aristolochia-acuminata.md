## Natural Occurrence:
A robust, perennial vine of rainforest & monsoon forest
from Mackay north to Cape York. Extends to drier scrubs.

## Appearance:
Vine lacks tendrils, but will scramble to
treetops. In drier areas, stems may die back to
rootstock in the dry. Flowers are purple/brown
& tubular, and arise on new growth.

## Growth Conditions:
Young vines prefer dappled/heavy shade -
mature vines will seek the sun & form dense
mats at canopy tops/sides. Grows in a variety
of soils, but should be kept moist (esp. when
young) & well-drained. Can be pruned, but cut
stems may need support for climbing.

## Distinctive Features:
Food plant for caterpillars of Cairns
Birdwing, Cape York Birdwing, Big
Greasy, Clearwing Swallowtail, &
Red-bodied Swallowtail Butterflies.

## Botanical Family: ARISTOLOCHIACEAE
